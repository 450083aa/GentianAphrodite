      When I was a young man, I had liberty, but I didn’t see it. I had time, but I didn’t know it. And I had love, but I didn’t feel it. Many decades would pass before I understood the meaning of all three. And now, the twilight of my life, this understanding has passed into contentment.

      Love, liberty, and time: once so disposable, are the fuels that drive me forward. And love, most especially, mio caro. For you, our children, our brothers and sisters. And for the vast and wonderful world that gave us life, and keeps us guessing. Endless affection, mia Sofia.

  Forever yours, Ezio Auditore.
